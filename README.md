# LDTS_T06_G07 - FROGGER

## Game Description

The objective of the game is to direct Mr. Frog to its home (the grass) across three different
levels. The final destination is reached by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full 
of dangers while avoiding being run over or falling into the water, which would result in the 
loss of a life. The only player control is the 4-direction keyboard arrow keys, used to 
navigate the frog. Each click in one direction causes the frog to hop once in that same 
direction.
